# About

_Fielder_ is a form library for React and React Native that has been built from the ground up with a [field-first approach to validation](https://dev.to/andyrichardsonn/why-we-need-another-form-library-fielder-4eah).

## Features

Here are some of the features that stand us out from the crowd

- Synchronous validation - change events and validation occur in the same render
- Hooks that work - hooks react to validation changes
- Event-driven validation - handle validation differently depending on the event (change, blur, submit, etc.)
- Dynamic validation - just like your UI, validation evolves over time

## Basic usage

### Install Fielder

Add Fielder to your project.

```sh
npm i fielder
```

### Set up a form

Use the `useForm` to create a form.

```tsx
const myForm = useForm();

return <FielderProvider value={myForm}>{children}</FielderProvider>;
```

### Create some fields

Use the `useField` hook to create a field.

```tsx
const [usernameProps, usernameMeta] = useField({
  name: 'username',
  initialValue: '',
  validate: useCallback(({ value }) => {
    if (!value) {
      throw Error('Username is required!');
    }
  }, []),
});

return (
  <>
    <input type="text" {...usernameProps} />
    <span>{usernameMeta.error}</span>
  </>
);
```
